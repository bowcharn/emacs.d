emacs.d
=======
This is my emacs' configuration for C/C++. I am a beginner. I have read some other's
configuration, but all of them are complex for me.

The configuration support:
1) 80 column mark
2) gtags for browse codes
3) self modeline
4) auto parentheses
5) code completion for yourself OS, you can add all "includes"
6) and many others.......
